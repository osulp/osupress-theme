# Adding new content to the new OSU Press Site

Before adding new content, make sure you are logged in. Go to `dev.osupress.oregonstate.edu/user` and log in with your ONID account. When logged in, you should see a navigation menu at the top of the screen. If that menu does not include a `Content` option, check with a site administrator to make sure you have the correct permissions.

Keep in mind as you are adding content that many parts of the site are cached at an hourly interval. If your changes do not show up initially, wait an hour and check again.

## Part 1: Adding Authors
If you are going to add book whose author has not previously been added to the site, you will need to complete this step first.

1. Navigate to Content -> Add Content -> Press Author in the black navigation bar at the top of the the screen and click the link.
2. At this screen, fill out the fields for which information about the author exists. The title field should be the full name of the author.
3. When adding the author's photo, press `Browse`. If you have already uploaded the image, navigate to `My files` in the menu under the `Library` tab and select the file. Otherwise, you can upload a new file in the `Upload` tab.
4. When you are finished, click `Save`.

## Part 2: Adding Books
1. Navigate to Content -> Add Content -> Press Book in the black navigation bar at the top of the screen and click the link. **Make sure to use Press Book and not Book**.
2. At this screen, fill out the fields for which information exists. This should be basically the same process as adding a book on the old site. When you are entering the author name, try typing their first name and waiting for the form to suggest an existing author below the input field. Click on that when it appears.
  1. If the author does not exist, follow the instructions in part 1 and then return to this part.
3. Once you have added all of the information you have for the book, navigate to the bottom of the page and click `save`. You should be redirected to a page on the site showing information for the book. If you forgot to enter any information, or entered information incorrectly, click on the `edit` tab above the page header for the book page. When you have updated the book information, click `save` at the bottom of the page.
4. Repeat this process for each book you need to add for the season.

## Part 3: Adding a catalog

Make sure you have both a pdf document for the catalog and a cover image before starting this process.

1. Navigate to Content -> Add Content -> Catalog in the black navigation bar at the top of the screen and click the link.
2. For the title, enter the name of the catalog e.g. "Spring 2018". Leave the body section blank--it is not used anywhere in the site.
3. When adding the cover image, press `Browse`. If you have already uploaded the image, navigate to `My files` in the menu under the `Media Browser` heading, select your image, and click `Submit`. Otherwise, click `Choose File`, select the file from your computer, and then click `Upload`. When the upload is complete, click `Next`. You can use "(Catalog Name) Cover Image" for the alt text and title text. When you have completed these fields, click `save`.
4. Follow basically the same procedure for the `pdf_document` field. You will not have to enter an alt text or title text.
5. **If you don't want this catalog to appear on the front page of the site** (i.e. it is for a future season), click on the `Publishing Options` tab in the menu at the bottom of the page above the `Save` and `Preview` buttons. Uncheck the `Published` and `Promoted to front page` boxes. You can change these options later when you want to publish the catalog.
6. When you are finished, click `Save`. Repeat for any other catalogs you need to upload.

## Part 4: Adding a season

**Do not start this step before uploading all books for the season**.

1. Navigate to Content -> Add Content -> Season in the black navigation bar at the top of the screen and click the link.
2. For the title, enter the name of the season e.g. "Spring 2018". Leave the body blank as it is not used. Enter the year in YYYY format, and select the appropriate season value from the dropdown.
3. In the books field, start typing the name of the first book you want to add. After entering the first 1-3 words, pause and see if the field suggests the name of the book. If nothing appears, finishing typing the name. If there are still no suggestions and there are no spelling errors in your input, make sure you have added and published the book. The auto-completion is not case sensitive.
4. Press `Add another item` and repeat step 3 in the blank field added below your previously added book. Repeat this step for each book in the season.
5. **If you don't want this season to appear on the front page of the site** click on the `Publishing options` tab in the menu at the bottom of the page above the `Save` and `Preview` buttons. Uncheck the `Published` and `Promoted to front page` boxes. You can change these options later when you want to publish the season. The front page will automatically show the two most recent published seasons.
6. When you are finished entering data, click `Save`. If the season is published, it will appear at the bottom of the front page.

## Part 5: Book Display Sets

### Adding a book display set

1. Navigate to Content -> Add Content -> Book Display Set in the black navigation bar at the top of the screen and click the link.
2. For the title, add the title you would like to show as the main header for the display set. For the description, add a short description of the display set. Keep this between 1 and 3 lines (as seen on the front page) to avoid disrupting the site layout. You can leave this field blank as well.
3. In the books field, start typing the name of the first book you want to add. After entering the first 1-3 words, pause and see if the field suggests the name of the book. If nothing appears, finishing typing the name. If there are still no suggestions and there are no spelling errors in your input, make sure you have added and published the book. The auto-completion is not case sensitive.
4. Press `Add another item` and repeat step 3 in the blank field added below your previously added book. Repeat this step for each book in the season.
5. **If you don't want this display set to appear on the front page of the site** click on the `Publishing options` tab in the menu at the bottom of the page above the `Save` and `Preview` buttons. Uncheck the `Published` and `Promoted to front page` boxes. You can change these options later when you want to publish the display set. The front page will automatically show the two most recent published display set.
6. When you are finished entering data, click `Save`. If the display set is published, it will appear at the top of the front page.

### Using Display Sets

Currently (as of June 2018), due to technical and time limitations, the front page can only show the most recent published display set. If you want to rotate between multiple, reused display sets, you should unpublish display sets you are not using. When you want to show a display set, unpublish the current display set and publish or add the display set you want to use.
